# Blockchain for Agricultural Supply Chain

## Project Description

A blockchain-based solution to enhance transparency, traceability, and trust in the agricultural supply chain. This system enables farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to track agricultural products from origin to destination using smart contracts deployed on a secure blockchain network.

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain by creating a decentralized, tamper-proof, and real-time tracking system. Through blockchain technology, we aim to empower all stakeholders with reliable information about the journey of agricultural products, reducing fraud, minimizing waste, and building consumer trust.

## Future Scope

- **Integration with IoT**: Real-time data from sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity) can be linked with blockchain entries for automated updates.
- **AI-Based Analytics**: Predict trends, detect anomalies, and optimize supply chain performance using AI models.
- **Mobile Applications**: User-friendly interfaces for farmers and consumers to interact with the system.
- **Cross-border Supply Chain**: Support for international standards and multi-currency transactions.
- **Carbon Footprint Tracking**: Add features to track and report environmental impact throughout the product lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Traceability**: Track every stage of the supply chain from farm to fork.
- **Immutable Records**: All transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate and enforce agreements between stakeholders.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for farmers, transporters, distributors, and retailers.
- **Transparency & Trust**: All participants can verify the history and status of products in real time.
- **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all interactions for regulatory compliance and quality assurance.
